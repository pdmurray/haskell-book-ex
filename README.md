## Haskell Book exercises and problems

Contained within this project are my Haskell source files for all of the exercises from the book
"Haskell Programming from First Principles" by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki.

It is arranged as a stack project, but the app/Main.hs doesn't do much.

The exercises are simply arranged in folders organized by chapter under src/.  They can be evaluated 
independantly by loading each file into the REPL.
